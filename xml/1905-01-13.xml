                    <head type="sub">DEPARTURE FROM SUEZ.</head><p>
                        (From Our Own Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>Suez, Thursday.</p>
                    <p>The Russian squadron, consisting of four cruisers, “Dnieper," “Rion," “Oleg," and “Izumrud,” and three torpedo-destroyers, “Gromki,” “Gosni," and “Riezvy,” under Admiral Botrovosky, entered the Canal yesterday forenoon. The destroyers reached Ismailia shortly after 4 p.m., when they anchored for the night, and resumed their voyage at 6 30 this morning. The cruisers, having searchlights, came through without stopping, and arrived at Suez at 5 o'clock this morning, anchoring in the Bay. At 10 a.m. the three destroyers came out of the Canal and anchored near the remainder of the squadron.</p>
                    <p>All the ships are fitted with wireless telegraphy apparatus and quick-firing guns. The “Dnieper” and “Rion” (ex “Petersburg" and “Smolensk" respectively), as well as the destroyers, are painted slate colour, while the two other cruisers have the usual Russian naval colour.</p>
                    <p>At this end of the canal they did not take on any coal, but were allowed to take a certain quantity of provisions and live-stock. During their stay they did not communicate with the shore owing to the plague at Suez, and wore flying the voluntary quarantine flags, in order to receive free pratique at Djibouti, where they intend coaling.</p>
                    <p>Several police and Coast Guard launches were patrolling the harbour, and almost similar precautions were taken as before, when the first division passed through.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the arrangements of the Suez Canal Company, no steamer in the canal was detained, in spite of the large traffic.</p>
                    <p>The Russian Squadron intends sailing tonight, or at daybreak to-morrow, for Djibouti.</p>
                    <p>Suez, Friday.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Botrovosky’s squadron sailed at 5.40 this morning for Djibouti.</p></div>

                    Lewa Hunter Pasha, Director-General of tbe Coast Guards Administration, and Mrs. Hunter and friends have gone for a trip down the Red Sea to Suakin and district. They hope to have a very pleasant trip, as the climatic conditions in those parts at this time of the year are excellent.</p>	
                    <p>The ostensible and official reason for this trip is that the Director-General of the administration has gone on a camel purchasing expedition, and Kaimakam Dumreicher Bey is accompanying the expedition in order to give his advice. These constant pleasure trjps of the highest officials of the Coast Guards Administration are always taken on the flimsiest excuse, for it is perfectly obvious that the presence of the Director-General of the administration is not necessary in order to buy camels, which any responsible subordinate officer could undertake. At present it is the busiest season of the year, and there is more opportunity for smuggling when the Customs officials are overworked, owing to the pressure their time due to the great influx of trade at this season, and the absence of Lewa Hunter Pasha on a pleasure excursion has aroused much comment, especially among the native officials in this administration</p></div>

                        <p>These teams met on the parade-ground, Mustapha, on Saturday last, when an interesting game was witnessed by a fair turn-out of spectators. Saint Andrews kicked off against the wind, and some nice exchanges came the way of both sides. The homesters were showing the better combination, and the visitors' defence had their work cut out to keep them from getting through. Success came their way eventually, Walmer taking up the ball from a well placed corner kick, and screwing it in in a most masterly fashion, giving the Saints’ custodian no chance to save. Half-time arrived with the score 1-0. The “Saints” in the second half tried hard to equalise, but, although both ends were visited in turn, no further scoring took place, “C" Company thus retiring victors by 1-0. The following were the teams :—</p>

                        <p>l*s recettes municipales qui étaient «MM modestes à l’origine de l'iastitettoo, ee sont aooruee rapidement eUnjourd’hei »*rebudget atteint une «estime de près de 900,000 irâra. Malheureusement les facultés administratives d'absorption se sont dév^oppéas avec non moins de rapidité et le muphte des naèttes disparaît toujonre avec une extrême facilité dans le gouffre des dépenses.</p>
                            <p>L'année passée déjà, nos bhégérira— mnni-eipaux approuvèrent avoua difficulté A disposer intégralement d'on total de «èafttre de lfttOOO livras. Cette année les 16,000 livres d'augmentation de revenu lie leur ont apnaé aucun embarras. La somme intégrale a été- inscrite aux dépenses.</p>
                            <p>Dans de telles conditions, en supposant que l’augmentation oootinue graduellement et que les téoettes de 1906 dépassent 900,000 fines, on peut s'attendra à ee que oette tomme soit aagloatie de la “-“tra «vif in</p>
                            <p>Ce qui surprend davantage dans le budget de 1905, c’est que l'augmentation des dépensa ne provient pas d'une pin forte somma de travail aooempU par l'administration, puis presque uniquement d'une majoration, de traita mente du penonoaL II n’est pas are» intérêt à ce propos de rechercher la proportion qei «date entra le travail fourni par la Municipalité et Us émoluments qu’elle distribue à ara employés pour voir s’il y avait lieu d’opéwr cette majoration d’appointementei</p>

La Ole du Gaz figura dans oette catégorie pour 92,050 L.B, d'éclairage la Oie des Baux pour 6,460 LK d’eau (190 pour F Administration Centrale, 500 pour le curage des égouts, 5,000 pour le nettoiement, 600 pour les para et plantations, 240 pour l'abattoir \ la pompions pour 4,950 LK, la sociétés de bien-faisanoes et eutraepoar 5,040 L.K, le fonds de prévojranoe du personne pour 9,400 LE, le servioe de l'emprunt pour 90,250 LE., fos frais judiciaires pour 125 LE., la expropriations pour 4,000 L.B., la polioe municipale pour 565 L.E., la réserve pour 3,700 LE.— Soit un total de près de 70,000 L.E.—Cette somme ne représente aucun travail fourni par la Municipalité et doit donc fitre mise de oôté pour la proportion qne nous voulons établir.</p>
                            <p>La traitements du . personnel classé, non olassé et hors cadre atteignent environ 50,000 ivres, y compris 5 à 6,000 livra de frais divers' (bureau etc.).
