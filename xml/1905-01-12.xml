                        <p>Emperor, in asking the assent of the Tsar and the Mikado to the granting of the order of merit to Generals Stoessel and Nogi, telegraphed to the Tsar. "The defence of Port Arthur will ever be an example to soldiers of all nations. The hero commanding your                troops is admired by the whole world and especially by my army and myself. I am conferring the same honor on his brave opponent.</p>
                        <p>The Kaiser also telegraphed to the Mikado: "The siege of Port Arthur has shown General Nogi to be a brave and prudent commander, whose heroic deeds, and those of his troops will ever be shared by all soldiers, and especially by myself and my army. His brave opponent is receiving the same distinction.</p>
                        <p>The Tsar replied that he highly appreciated the sympathy of the Kaiser and his army. General Stoessel has gallantly done his duty to the end at the head of hi brave garrison.</p>
                        <p>The Mikado replied that he was much           by his Majesty's admiration for the         of Port Arthur, and assented with              the Kaiser's and wish to confer on                               in the Prussian.

With this in their possession the two started on their trip: The father quickly apprised the police, who telegraphed to the various moudiriehs a description of the delinquents. The latter had made for Edfu, but on their way alighted at Keneh, in order to spend some of their money there. Here they attracted the attention of a detective and were arrested by him. Having part of the stolen money well as the diamond earring in their possession, there was no doubt as to their identity, and they were soon sent back to Cairo in custody.</p></div></div>

                        <p>(From our Special Correspondent).</p>
                        <p>Port Said, Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>The long-expected squadron has at last arrived here. Though due to arrive at dawn, and passed in the night by the British S.S. “Scot,” a ship of 10 knots which arrived here at 10 a.m., the fleet was not off the port until 2.30 p.m. The P. and O. mail steamer “Egypt" arrived oft the port at the same time, and had to give precedence to the warships, but no doubt the interesting event compensated the. passengers for the delay.</p>
                            <p>The day was fine and bright, a light northwest wind was blowing, and the sea was smooth ; but notwithstanding this the two protected cruisers of the fleet rolled heavily, even when, to some extent, under the lee of the breakwater. This defect has been noticeable in nearly all the Russian warships that have passed through the canal, and it must be a serious handicap to their gunnery practice in a seaway.</p>
                            <p>A considerable number of people gathered along the front to watch the passage of the ships, and many cameras were in evidence, the probability of most of these ships being sent to the bottom before long no doubt acting as an incentive to collect souvenirs.</p>
                            <p>A large number of Russian spies have been noticed in the town for some days. Weird, unkempt-looking individuals, they loaf about the cafés in an aimless way, day and night, doing nothing, for there is certainly not the slightest work for them to do here. Precautionary measures have, it is true, been taken by the authorities ; but not to the same elaborate extent as before, and the spirit of the officers in charge of these duties is that of an amused participator in a harmless pantomine.</p>
                            <p>The first vessels of the fleet to enter the harbour were two of the destroyers, followed closely by the flagship "Oreg.” Another destroyer followed, then came the second-class cruiser "Izumrund,” followed by the Volunteer Fleet ships "Rion” and ‘‘Dnieper.’’ These last two vessels are, respectively, our old friends the "Smolensk" and “Petersburg,” which passed the Dardanelles under the merchant and Red Cross flags and seized, amongst other ships, the P. and O. steamer “Malacca.” The new names they bear, and the coat of dark grey paint, are no doubt a concession to England’s vigorous protest, followed by the demonstration made in these waters in July last by eight battleships of our Mediterranean Squadron, on account of the breach of the Treaty of Paris.</p>
                            <p>The "Rion” and “Dnieper” look smart and well-kept, but the “Oreg” and “Izumrud,” notwithstanding the fact that they are comparatively new ships, look rather seedy, and do not strike one as having been in dry-dock of late.</p>
                            <p>The fleet will prove a useful reinforcement to Admiral Rodjestvensky, for, as will be seen from the following particulars, they are all fast and well-armed ships :—</p>
                            <p>“Oreg.” Flagship. 1st class protected cruiser. Speed 23 knots. Guns: 12 six inch, 12 three-inch, 8 three pounders, 2 1 pounders. Two submerged torpedo tubes, and 2 torpedo tubes above water-line.</p>
                            <p>“Izumrud. ’ 2nd class protected cruiser. Speed 22.5 knots. Guns : 6 4 7, 8 three-pounders, 5 torpedo tubes above water line.</p>
                            <p>“Rion.” Speed 19 1/2 knots. Guns : 8 4 7, 8 three-pounders, 4 one-pounder, 2 Maxims.</p>
                            <p>“Dnieper. ’ Speed 19.5 knots. Guns: 8 4 7., 6 3-inch, 3 Maxims.</p>
                            <p>Three destroyers of similar class, 350 tons diplacement each. Speed 26 knots.</p>
                            <p>From these details it will be seen that the fleet is a scouting, rather than a fighting, force, two of the cruisers having no protection whatever. The other two, having only armoured decks and gun shields, could not hope to successfully engage the powerful armoured cruisers of Japan.</p></div>

                        <p>(From our own Correspondent).</p>
                        <p>Constantinople, January 5.</p>
                        <p>A new financial establishment, to be styled the Orient Bank, has been founded by the Banque Nationale of Athens and the National Bank of Berlin. The statutes of this bank have already been published in the “Official Gazette” at Athens. Agencies will be opened very shortly at Alexandria, Constantinople, and Smyrna, probably at the end of the next month. The well-known local banker, M. Zarifi, has accepted the post of adviser to the bank.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to what was announced, it is now stated that no shares whatsoever are to be issued, the capital of ten million francs having been wholly subscribed by the two banks interested, the National of Greece and the National of Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The manager of the Hellenic National Bank has arrived here from Athens, where he was lately received by King George, who expressed his satisfaction at the co-operation of the two banks. The agency in Constantinople will be placed under the superintendence of a committee composed of M. E. Engénidés, M. S. Zarifi, and M. T. Mavrogordato, of our city.</p>
                        <p>A London financial correspondent sends us the following information on the same subject:</p>
                        <p>—Considerable interest attaches to the formation of the “Orient Bank" by the National-bank fur Deutschland and the Banque Nationale de Gréce. The capital will be Fr. 10,000,000 (gold), of which each of the founder institutions takes one-half. The seat of the new bank will be Athens, but its chief field of operations will be Turkey, Asia Minor, and Egypt, its principal business the financing of the export and import trade. It is believed that the assistance of the German institution will be of special value in Turkey, where German influence is at present paramount.</p></div>

                        <p>The Board of Directors of the new Land Bank of Egypt is composed as follows : Chairman : Mr. Ambroise Zervudachi; Directors: Messrs. Joseph Aghion, J. E.

                    <p>Last June Mohamed Said Pasha, wekil of the Daira of Sheikh Ibrahim Pasha, issued the following notice on behalf of the estate, which was published in all the newspapers of Alexandria ;—</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Mohamed Said Pasha, wekil of the Daira of the late Sheikh Ibrahim Pasha, informs the public that, in view of the popular complaints against the in-increase of the rents in Alexandria, of the smallness and paucity of business at present, and of the duty of all honorable people in the common interest and of the benevolent feelings which should animate this question, the family of the late Sheikh Ibrahim Pasha have decided, in the interests of humanity and in solicitude for the poor, not to increase the rents of their property.</p>
                    <p>The generosity of this brought forth a great deal of laudation, as such conduct was so different from that which generally characterises the Alexandrian landlord. The moderation and philanthropy were praised to the skies and the course adopted was pointed out as an example to others. The Sheikh promised the Tenants Commission that he would also do his best to urge other landlords to exercise the same moderation.</p>
                    <p>This, however, appears to have been a practical joke on the part of the owner, for they have recently informed their tenants that their rents would be raised, and the additions that are being made to the rents are furthermore very excessive.</p></div>

                    <head type="sub">PROMISES TO BE A RECORD ONE</head>
                    <p>We are informed that the managers of the hotels in the Capital, as well as at Helouan, Mena House, and up-river, are jubilant at the large number and class of tourists that are already crowding all the winter resorts of Egypt, and there are unmistakable signs in all directions that the present will prove to be the record season, surpassing even the last, which was considered the best so far.</p>
                    <p>As an instance, we may say that at one of the leading Cairo hotels,—the Grand Continental,—there was a daily average during the month of November of no less than 120 visitora more than during the corresponding month of the previous year, and for December the daily number was even greater. Shepheard’s has been crowded for weeks, and the other fashionable hostelries, the Savoy and Ghezireh Palace Hotels, are also filling up rapidly.</p>
                    <p>The smaller hotels everywhere report the same good news, and the managers aver that never before have their houses been full so early, despite the large number of tourists that have already left for the Nile trip and Khartoum.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>THE SAKHARA INCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>In regard to the stories about the attack on some tourists by Bedouins at Sakhara which have been appearing in the Cairo newspapers, we hear on high authority that there is a good deal to be said on the other side. An official enquiry is about to be held, and we will refrain from commenting on the affair as it is sub-justice. Some of our contemporaries seem to us to have been a little too hasty in assuming that the fault was entirely on one side.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>COUNCIL OF MINISTERS.</head>
                    <p>The Council of Ministers met this morning at Abdeen Palace under the presidency of the Khedive to consider the projet de loi concerning the Assize Courts.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>REGISTRATION OF DOGS.</head>
                    <p>We hear that the new regulations for the registration of dogs are almost completed. We welcome the news and hope that no misguided Europeans will attempt to take shelter behind the Capitulations, and to avoid compliance with a measure dictated by common prudence.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>MINISTRY OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION.</head>
                    <p>We would desire to draw attention to the prominence given to the Ministry of Public instruction in the Note recently published by the Financial Adviser. The budget for 1905 has been increased by L.E 31,300 over that of 1904. This is a gratifying feature and, with out doubt, will tend towards a general improvement of the education of the country. Hitherto young educated Egyptians have found it more profitable to pursue their higher studies for qualification in Medicine, Law, and the more liberal professions. Teaching as a profession did not seem to offer many adequate prizes ; but we have no hesitation in stating that a perusal of the table of salaries issued by the Ministry will turn the thoughts of many Egyptian parents towards the adoption of the teaching profession for their sons.</p>
                    <p>From this table we observe that L.E.16,360, which represents the sum specified in the Financial Adviser's Note for the improvement in the status of the staff, together with other money disposable for the same purpose, or rather more than half the total increase of the budget for 1905, will be devoted to advance the position of such officials as are engaged in school-work. To this substantial addition must also be added the increases of salary accorded by the Ministry each year in the month of January.</p>
                    <p>Admission to the higher posts held by teachers
                        is by means of the Training Colleges. Native inspectors and sub-inspectors of kuttabs are drawn from the Nasrieh Training College ; while attendance at the Training College for English-speaking natives opens the way to the headmasterships of Primary schools. We would particularly call attention to the greatly improved prospects of the headmasters and senior teachers in Primary schools.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>CAIRO DEACONESSES’ HOSPITAL.</head>
                    <p>The many alterations and improvements that have been carried out during the past few months at the above hospital, and which it was hoped would have been completed by the 1st December last, will not be finished for another month or so, the delay having been caused by the native workmen employed. The whole of the masonry work in connection with the second floor that has been added to the hospital is now finished, and the plasterers, painters, and carpenters are busy completing the remaining work, but it is not intended to open the new wards before the 1st April, so as to allow time for them to dry thoroughly before admitting patients. In the mean while the old 1st and 2nd class wards on the first floor, which had been closed for some months during the building operations, have been reopened to paying patients. The new lift will also be in operation by the latter date.</p>
                    <p>The additions to the building include fourteen rooms, which will be reserved exclusively in future for paying patients of European nationality, and the old wards will then be retained for natives. On the second storey there will be likewise a new special operating-room , fitted with all the latest improvements. This was needed in consequence of the great increase in the number of operations during the past few years.</p></div>

                    <p>H.B. Mgr. Cyril, Greek-Catholic Patriarch at Alexandria, has sent an address of gratitude to the Sultan for the Imperial alms distributed every year on Christmas and New Year’s Day to the poor of the Melchite community. In the letter of the Pope, which the Patriarch conveyed to the Sultan, the Holy Father expressed his thanks for the favors enjoyed by Catholics in the Ottoman Empire.</p></div>

                    <p>Luxor, Tuesday.</p>
                    <p>The Marquis di Rudini arrived here this morning by the “train de luxe.” He was met at the station by the Italian consular agent here, Mr. Endraons, who accompanied him to the Luxor Hotel, where the Italian Minister is staying. Marquis di Rudini spent the day strolling round the city and visiting the ruins of Karnak. To-morrow he will go to see Thebes and the Tombs of the Kings. On Thursday morning he is proceeding to Assouan, and from thence to Khartoum. He is expected back at Assouan on the 28th inst. After returning to Cairo his Excellency intends going on to Erythrea, where he will make a lengthy tour with Marquis Talamo.</p></div>

                <div type="item"><head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head><p>
                    There was a large house at the Zizinia theatre last night for the third performance ot Giordano's new opera, “Siberia.” The audience, however, appeared, as on the previous occasions, to be affected by the coldness of the surroundings. The interpretation was good, especially as regards Signora Amelia Pinto in the role of Stephana and the baritone Nani as Gleby. The chorus was better than ever, the Siberian exiles’ chorus, in particular, being exceedingly well rendered. The orchestra was excellent.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>VERDI THEATRE, CAIRO.</head><p>
                    The Verdi Theatre was the scene on Tuesday of a most delightful performance of “The Barber of Seville.” The house was well filled, and all the actors took the keenest interest in their parts, with the result that a most successful ensemble was ensured. Signora Svicher again astonished us all by her wonderful vocalism. She seems to possess no less than three octaves in her voice, and every note is taken with ease and clearness : her singing was a marvel of technique and withal charming in tone. Signor Tomisani still appears to be suffering from a slight cold, but all through the 3rd act he was delightful. We would mention the others did it not seem invidious to single out anyone where all were so uniformly good, and, we may add, so highly appreciated by the audience.</p></div>
