                        <p>A sanguinary dispute occurred here between the Latin and Greek clergy
                            whilst the latter were performing the Christmas midnight mass.
                                <persName>The Patriarch</persName> was officiating at
                                <placeName>Bethlehem</placeName>. The Latins were apparently the
                            aggressors, for when the Greek ecclesiastics in vestments were issuing
                            from the northern entrance of the Giotto of the Nativity, the Franciscan
                            monks barred their way and a collision ensued, with the result that one
                            Franciscan was seriously wounded and the Patriarch’s janissary slightly
                            so. The <persName>Governor of Jerusalem</persName> went to the Grotto.
                            Notwithstanding their exclusive ownership of the eastern entrance, the
                            Greeks were ultimately allowed to pass through the northern door, hence
                            the jealousy. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>The P. 0. SB. “Mongolia" reached <placeName>Port Said</placeName> on Thursday
                        afternoon, and after taking in 1,200 mail bags and 800 tons of ooal, left
                        for Suez, from which port she sailed on Friday evening. The voyage from
                        England was full of disagreeable incidents. She was detained for two days at
                            <placeName>Tilbury</placeName> in the blackest of fogs, which rendered
                        it impossible for the passengers to go ashore, but when the fog lifted for a
                        few hours on Christmas Day she lost no time in starting. The overland
                        passengers reached <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> on Friday, December 30,
                        to be told that the “Mongolia” had only just left
                            <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>, and they must stay at a hotel at the
                        company's expense. When the steamer arrived on the following day, so strong
                        a mistral was blowing from the N. N. W. that she could neither get into
                        dock, nor could a tug proceed to her. She therefore took up a position of
                        safety under the hills to the west of the town, where she was shortly joined
                        by a dozen other steamers which were unable to make the port. On New Year’s
                        Day the French agent of the P. and 0. Company made some in adequate
                        arrangements by which some 200 passengers succeeded in boarding the steamer
                        with their luggage. The sea was then less rough because the wind had dropped
                        somewhat bat it was so cold that no one was surprised to see snow falling.
                        The bad weather and numerous snow storms lasted until the Straits of Messina
                        had been passed, after which the weather became fairly good, with the
                        exception of occasional showers of hail and rain. The ship travelled well in

                        Abbas Helmy Theatre, where mirth is combined with first-rate music. The
                        Soarez operetta company is meeting with a success, which was richly
                        deserved. Full houses are the order of the day, rather night, and the
                        auditorium generally resounds with laughter from beginning to end of the
                        performance. Les P'tetites Brebis on Saturday and La Mascotte last night
                        were huge successes. This may he readily understood when we say that the
                        present company is the best comic opera combination that has ever visited
                        Egypt The singers are faultless, the music is equally excellent, and the
                        costumes and staging are admirable. <persName>Signa. Soarez</persName> and
                            <persName>Sig. Gravina</persName> are alone worth going to the theatre

                            adopted by: the Ramlehites at the mass meeting on Saturday evening, and
                            that harmonious relations have at last'been re-established between the.
                            railway directors, and the public. The mass meeting on Saturday evening
                            was, a great success. In spite of the inclemency of the weather and of
                            the ravages of influenza there was a large and enthusiastic gathering of
                            Ramlehites, and the venerable pile, known to fame as the Theatre of
                            Bacos, was crowded from top to bottom with an audience who bad mustered
                            from every quarter of the Ramleh district. Soon after 9 o'clock the

                            fatto il nostro possibile per calmare gli spiriti, fecendo passi al
                            governatorato ed all'amministrazione della compagnia per cio che
                            riguarda i disordini causati della presenza della polizia alla stazione,
                            e siamo riusciti a allontanare la forza anche per il bene dei poveri
                            agenti che morivano di fame. D’altronde la delegazione ha sempre pensato
                            che le differenze che sorgono tra il pubblieo ed una pubblica
                            amministrazione devono essere solo risolti civilmente e non all’ombra
                            della polizia, che e spauracchio per i malfattori e non per gente onesta
                            quale noi siamo. Signori ! noi siamo riusciti a fare mantenere dalla

                            domandato delle limitazione. L’amministrazione fara degli abbonamenti
                            trimestrali, - semistrali ed annuali e cio nel modo seguente: Per un
                            trimestre dara tre carnets che saranno valevoli per i tre mesi e alia
                            scadenzadi questi i biglietti rimaneuti non avranno piu alcun valore.
                            Ogni carnet avra 120 biglietti, cioe 4 ogni giorno. Per un semestre dara
                            6 carnett } nella stessa proporzione del trimestre. Per un anno dark 12
                            carnets nella proporzione come sopra. E bene inteso che questi carnett
                            sono personali esclusivamente. Per mezzo della nostra energica
                            abnegazione i carnets oggi essistenti resteranno allo stesso | prezzo di

                            biglietti saranno calcolati nella medesima proporzione. Noi abbiamo
                            insistito presso S.E. Bogos Pacha Nubar perche alla limitazione dei
                            viaggi sia dato un compenso per i viaggi intermediari ed a tale uopo
                            domandammo 10 biglietti ogni mese al di fuori di quelli compresi in ogni

                        <p>The president’s speech was followed by a dis-course from <persName>M.
                                Zenie</persName>, another member of the Ramleh Delegation who spoke
                            in French and Arabic. He dwelt on the great debt whioh all the
                            Ramlehites were under to the president, owing to whose energy,
                            pertinacity, and diplo macy the population of Ramleh had been freed from
                            the yoke which the, directors of -the Railway Company had vainly
                            endeavoured to place on them. While this speech was proceed-ing it
                            became clear that there was a strong opposition to the amicable
                            settlement as proposed by the president. But by the explanation which
                                <persName>Mr. Quintavalle</persName> addressed to the dissen-tients,
                            it was manifest that this opposition was due to failure to grasp the
                            tenour of the president’s speech. One member of the audience reproached
                            the meeting with the charge that all they really wanted was to travel
                            free. This opprobrious imputation was severely resented by the
                            Ramlehites. Another incident occurred when two engineers got up and
                            addressed the meeting on the subject of a motor service. When these
                            gentlemen began to speak, the delegatee withdrew, as the subject under
                            dis-cussion was not on the order of the day moreover the president had-
                            refused to assent to these gentlemen, Messrs. Arcondoulis and Movesse,
                            making any 'remarks. The delegates and the Ramlehites then marched to
                            the residences of <persName>Mr. Alderson</persName> and. <persName>M.
                                Jacot de Combes</persName>, whom they serenaded. ' The delegates
                            have been entrusted with a mandate to enter into negotiations with the

                            Railway Com-pany :--- “The Board of Directors, taking into consideration
                            that the suppression of season tickets or “abonnements,” was not decided
                            on with the object of increasing the tariff but only with the intention
                            of putting an cud to abuses, which had taken such proportions as to be
                            very prejudicial to the company’s interests, and being desirous of
                            conciliating, as much as possible, these interests with those of the
                            inhabitants of Ramleh, the Board has decided to replace the old season
                            tickets by books of tickets, which will be offered for sale, on and
                            after the 1st April next. " These books will be strictly personal, the
                            owner’s photograph will be attached to them, and they will contain a
                            number of tickets calculated on the basis of 400 journeys per quarter,
                            or three months. "There will be separate books for three, six, and
                            twelve months, containing 400; 800, or 1,600 tickets, at the prices of

                            £3.250, and £5.700 for the second class. “These books oft tickets will
                            be valid for three months, from the 1st January, 1st April, 1st July,
                            and 1st October of each year. "The tickets contained in these books will
                            only be valid when they are detached by the company's agents and used
                            during the quarter, half-year, or year to which they refer.
                            'Provisionally, and up to the time of the employment of the above
                            mentioned personal books of tickets, the former season-ticket holders,
                            whose tickets have now expired, will be able to receive for the first

                            of each season ticket, until the 31st March next. “Independently of the

                            January last, on ordinary books of 50 tickets, will be maintained, their

                <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                <p>Suakin, December 30.</p>
                <p>H.M.S. “Sealark,” survey ship, returned here from Sheikh Barghout on the 23rd inst. At daybreak on the 24th the Commander's valet was suddenly taken ill, and expired very shortly after. The funeral procession took place at 2.30 p.m. the same day. All the officers and crew followed the mortal remains of the deceased in boats to the Christian cemetery on Quarantine Island. The burial service was read by the Commander and the usual naval honors were paid  to the deceased at the grave.</p>
                <p>The same evening (Christmas Eve) a grand concert was given by the Suakin Cosmopolitan Orchestra, under the directorship of Mr. Henry Moss, the popular Assistant Commandant Suakin Police. The orchestra is composed of a number of Sudan Government employes and is international. The function was a thorough and well deserved success, and the performance reflected the greatest credit on Mr. Muss. The Town Hall, where the concert was held, was tastefully decorated with flags and banners, kindly lent for the occasion by H.M.S. “Sealark” and the Sudan Government steamer “Mukhbir.” The progamma opened by the orchestra playing the March '‘Sardinia.” The Arabic song “Bi Cita Real Yabba Gows Ni,” by El Sayid el Hassan, was heartily encored, especially by the Egyptians. Mr. Kirby and Sig. Ura were successful in their violin duet and were encored several times. Mrs. Purvis elicited great praise by her charming rendering of the pianotorte solo, “Preghiera del Mose.” The orchestra played once more,this time "The English Gentleman," and was encored a second time. Corporal George, K.E., gave a most amusing recitation entitled “British Pluck,” by Kipling. Mr. Razzle, in his banjo solo, was a great success. Commander Somerville, R.N., of H.M.S. “Sealark,” at the request of the guests, sang an Irish comic song, and was encored so heartily that he had to give another. A. B. Myers, R.N., of H.M.S. "Sealark,” sang very well, and was encored by his mates to such an extent that he, too, had to give another song. The Khedivial Anthem was then played by the orchestra, and the proceedings ended with “God Save the King.”</p>
                <p>A well-stocked buffet was furnished for the guests by the Suakin Mondirieh and Jack Jar did ample justice to the good things that were provided for him. I was glad to see Kaimakam Drury Bey, R.N., Controller of Sudan Ports, on his feet again and entertaining his sailor friends. He was greatly cheered and several Britishers carried him around the hall shoulder-high singing "He's a jolly good fellow.”</p>
                <p>Among the guests were : Mr. Kerr, Acting Moudir of Suakin, Kaimakam Drury Bey, R.N., Controller Sudan Ports, Bimbashi Spencer, Inspector, Suakin Moudirieh, Bimbashi Ensor, Principle Medical Officer, Suakin Moudirieh, Commander Somerville, R.N., and all the officers of H.M.S. “Sealark,” Mr. Mackenzie, Superintendents Eastern Telegraph Company, Limited, Suakin, and several others.</p>
                <p>H.M.S. “Sealark" went to sea again on the 26th for surveying purposes.</p>
                <p>Miralai Macauley Bey, Director, Sudan Railways, went up as far as Railhead on the morning of the 23th inst. by a special train on inspection, returning to Suakin the same evening.</p>
                <p>The Khedivial mail steamer “Mehallah”
                    arrived here from Suet on the 28th inst, having on board Mr. C. M. Hickley, who has been acting Sudan Agent at Alexandria and who will now resume his duties with the Suakin-Atbara Bailway.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><p>“The Magazine of Commerce.”—This excellent monthly publication is now in its third year of publication, and its success shows that it has met a great want on the part of the British manufacturer and merchant. As a medium for the dissemination of knowledge of centre British inventions to our colonial business houses, it should command an increased circulation—especially in these days of foreign enterprise. The standard of literary merit is a high one, the magazine is illustrated throughout, and in the number for December, 1904, will be found an interesting sketch of Lord Ribblesdale’s career, an excellent portrait of his lordship forming the frontispiece of this issue. The Magazine of Commerce is published at 155 and 156, Cheapside, London.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>ACCESSION DAY.</head>
                <head type="sub">RECEPTION AND REVIEW.</head>
                <p>Yesterday’s Khedivial reception was largely attended, and from an early hour numbers visitors made their way to Abdeen Palace. The Diplomatic Agents and Consuls, the Minister and the Advisers, the heads of department, and many of the chief officers of the British Army of Occupation attended the reception, with a multitude of officials and notables. While it was in progess, many tourists and sight seers paid visits to Abdeen-square to watch the arrival of those who attended the reception, and to make guesses, sometimes very mistaken ones, at their identity.</p>
                <p>Cairo was favored with bright, if cool, weather. The streets, in consequence of the general holiday, were crowded, and the square before the Khedivial Opera House, the neighbourhood of Abdeen, and the Esbekieh Gardens were gaily decorated.</p>
                <p>The afternoon's review was a remarkably fine sight The appearance and marching of the troops was very good, and the cavalry, both when trotting and cantering past, went by splendidly, better even than last year. The galloping Maxims caused a good deal of interest to an enormous concourse.</p>
                <p>The management of the crowd—there must have been more than 15,000 persons round the parade-ground—reflects great credit on the police, and that too though there was not room in the carriage enclosure for all the carriages whose occupants had tickets, and the standing room was decidedly limited. The police, however, did well—there was no unnecessary  shooting, and the crowd, if packed pretty tightly, were as good-humoured as an Egyptian crowd can be.</p>
                <p>The order of the review was as follows:—</p>
                <p>Cavalry in line, artillery in line at half intervals.</p>
                <p>lnfantry in quarter-column of half-battalions at Iff; paces interval.</p>
                <p>After the infantry had passed and repassed the cavalry rode by at the trot and then at a canter. The Khedive took the salute from beside the standard. His Highness looked very well and was mounted on a very fine Arab. The principal officers of the staff and the bodyguard squadron were drawn up behind him. After the cavalry had cantered past, Lewa Lord Edward Cecil Pasha rode to the troops, followed by the officers of the Staff, and ordered the Khedivial salute, three times repeated by the troops and accompanied by the Khedivial Hymn. The Khedive then gave leave to dismiss the troops, and the review ended.</p>
                <p>Cairo was brilliantly decorated last night, the streets were full, and the xxx proceeded merrily in the Esbekieh Gardens. The decorations were illuminated. A fine pillarlike erection had been got into place near the statue of Ibrahim Pasha and was decorated with red and green lamps and, on the summit, with the crescent and star in white lights. Musicians, conjurors, sweetmeat-sellers, etc., swarmed and by 9 p.m. it was quite clear that Cairo — native Cairo at least—was going to amuse itself till early morning.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>MALTA.</head>
                <p>The report of Governor Sir C. M. Clarke on the affairs of the Colony of Malta during 1903-4 has been published in the annual series of Colonial Reports (No. 439, Cd. 2238-16). The revenue for the year 1903-4, exclusive of the value of stores issued, was £464,391, and the expenditure £410,887. The excess of revenue over expenditure for the year was, therefore, £53,704. Including £142, the value of stores issued during the year, and £19,416, the surplus brought forward from 1902-3, the net surplus standing to the credit of the Government at the dose of the financial year was £73,262. The total value of dutiable goods imported in 1903-4 was £7,158,079, showing an increase of £595,281 over the value of the imports in the preceding year. The increase is almost entirely found under wheat, which shows an advance of £579,899. Of the total imports, £1,318,430 is the value of goods landed for local consumption, against £1,361,650 in 1902-3; and £5,839,649 is the value of dutiable goods re-exported in the same bottoms, as against £5,301,148 in the previous year. The value of the dutiable goods exported in 1903 4, exclusive of local produce,was £6,145,883, as against £5,849,576 in 1902-3. This represents an increase of £796,307. The value of whole cargoes which were carried in the same bottoms were £6,022,107, and that of the portions of cargoes which were landed and reexported was £123,776. The number of British ships which entered the ports of Malta in 1903-4 was 1,335, as against 1,837 in the previous year, and their tonnage was 2,464,464, as against 2,390,761—a decrease of two ships and an increase of 73,703 tons. Foreign steamships showed a total of 1,079, with a tonnage of 1,062,420, as against 1,030, with a tonnage of 1,069,299 in 1902-3, an increase of 49 in ships, with a decrease of 6,979. The principal event of 1903 was the visit of his Majesty King Edward VII., who arrived on April 16 on board the Royal yacht Victoria and Albert and remained in Malta till the morning of the 20th. This was the first occasion on which Malta had been honored by a visit from the reigning Sovereign, and the King received a loyal and enthusiastic welcome from all classes. The report contains much information as to finance, trade, agriculture, legislation, education, and other matters.</p></div>

                <p>From letters which have been received at Cairo it seems that Sir Wm. Willcocks was greatly struck by the possibilities of Koweit. He says it is capable of making a splendid harbour and should be the future Alexandria of that country. He is delighted with the climate, and the comparative nearness to the Himalayas make work there seem much more feasible. Of course. he is full of the grandeur of the Euphrates, and writing to a correspondent from Basra, Sir William says:— The Euphrates is a splendid river here, as wide as the Nile at Cairo and half as deep, with millions of date palms on every side. I hope the country will turn out propitious when I find myself at Bagdad, where I hope to be on the 23rd orv24th (December). I am in Sindbad the Sailor’s home. He would have made loss voyages if he had been cursed with quarantines in his day.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>EGYPTOLOGICAL RESEARCH.</head>
                <p>During the past year a strong local committee of Liverpool men in connection with the University of Liverpool has been formed to promote the study of archaeology, and has been strengthened by such well-known names in this connexion as those of Dr. Arthur Evans, Mr. Hilton Price, Prof. Ridgeway, and Prof. Boyd Dawkins. They have taken premises in Bedford-street, where they have established, in addition to a small but fairly complete library, a museum of Egyptian antiquities, presented for the most part by the local patrons of Egyptian exploration, such as Sir John Brunner, Mr. William Johnston, and Mr. John Rankin. Many of these were discovered by Mr. John Garstang, the newly appointed Lecturer in Archaeology, and there are to be found here the duplicate ivory tablet of Aha, found by him at Negadah last year, many of the other objects exhibited by him at the Society of Antiquaries in the summer, and an entirely representative collection from Beni Hassan and elsewhere. A reception held in this museum on Saturday week by Lady Alice Stanley fitly inaugurated the Institute, of which the Princess Henry of Battenberg is the patron ; and the course of lectures announced, which include the archaeology of Greece and Western Asia, as well as that of Egypt, leave nothing to be desired. The Institute has also arranged to conduct excavations on its own account at Edfu and Esneh during the forthcoming season.</p></div>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—“Q.R.D.," in your issue of the 7th inst, has placed before your readers seriatim et numeratim the advantages afforded by this institution, with all of which I cordially concur. But I think that intending subscribers, before forwarding their donations, are entitled to be informed whether or not it is the fact that:—</p>
                    <p>(а)	The hospital is used for maternity
                        cases</p>
                    <p>(b)	Soldiers' wives, or rather, the wives of soldiers belonging to the Army of Occupation, are received therein for their confinement gratuitously</p>
                    <p>(e) Fifteen out of the twenty-two beds, which is all the hospital contains, were occupied during the past year at one and the same period by cases of the above description</p>
                    <p>I think, moreover, it ought to be stated whether, assuming the above questions are answered in the affirmative, it was the intention of the founders of this hospital that it should be used for lying-in purposes  and, furthermore, whether the executive committee intend to so use it henceforth.</p>
                    <p>I am, etc.,</p>
                    <p>Cairene.</p>
                    <p>Cairo, January 8.</p></div>
                <div type="item"><head>CHARITY ORGANISATION SOCIETY.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—Among the short paragraphs inserted above the initials “T. A.” under the heading “Under the Mosquito Net” in your issue of the 31st December last, the writer, in referring to “ cases of real destitution worthy o fhelp,” incidentally alludes in anything but complimentary terms to the Charity Organisation Society, which he (or she) most unfairly denominates that “Sham of Shams."</p>
                    <p>As an old subscriber to the abused society and a thorough believer, from knowledge, the good which for years past has resulted day by day from the fulfilment of the duties which the society in question has undertaken to perform, I cannot but think that “T. A" must have written his condemnation with but scant knowledge of facts, and perhaps will not object to my attempting to set him right and to my trying to prevent the injury which such comments might, if uncontradicted, inflict on a most deserving institution.</p>
                    <p>The Charity Organisation Society was not instituted for the administration of charitable funds, but for the guidance and assistance of the charitably disposed who might desire that their contributions to the aid of their less fortunate fellow-creatures should not pass into unworthy channels or assist in pauperising, instead of helping, those who might be willing although temporarily unable to support themselves and those dependent upon them.</p>
                    <p>From my own personal knowledge the secretary would be the last person to “turn a deaf oar” to any case of real distress which might come before him. It is not however part of the duty of this particular society to divert the proper employment of its funds to “seeking out" cases of distress, or to put itself into competition with other institutions, whether charitable or rate-aided, whose functions are different from its own, and which may be much better qualified to perform the work to which your correspondent refers.</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
                    <p>A. C. C.</p>
